# Dev Side of a Rocket Site

What would this repo INCLUDE:

- Anything that a developer or designer would need to touch
- Rocket files like `local.data.js` and `recursive.data.js` and their containing folders
- css and js that would only confuse the business person contributing content

What would this project EXCLUDE:

- Markdown files
- HTML files if these were sufficiently simple for the business person to maintain

## WHY???

Because giving the business person their own github repo for markdown content only is _almost_ practical for a content only maintenance process

## How?

I dunno, that is why I put this up, to solicit help from Thomas Almer

## Where?

The content is placed in https://github.com/petecarapetyan/rocket_min_2206_content_only in the `site/pages` directory, attempting to look exactly if that same content had been placed here!

## Really? Are you sure?

No
